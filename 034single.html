                                    <p> <b>The True Self Behind the Language Lens </b>
                                    </br></br>Have you ever thought about how multilingual express themselves in different languages? Behind each language, is there very distinct concepts underlying? Is multilingual ability sometimes a burden for people? While we built our languages from distinct culture and we mixed so many concepts that can never be translated, there seems to have so much complexity behind the magical language lens. Are the languages really possible to be integrated by the user and accurately present the information we want? The truth is that multilingual ability, or multilingual environment, actually helps people to present their ides more comprehensively. In this paper, we are going to illustrate that multilinguals are able to optimize their expressions from the experience with different languages, and to express one viewpoint in multiple ways. Also, multilinguals have the ability to address a broader audience. And most importantly, different languages won’t separate the user’s identity, nor can they represent cultures, they are, however, a useful tool for people to present themselves. 

                                    </br></br>  “If I want to participate in a debate, to argue eloquently, my first choice will be English. But when I want to depict the flowing of emotions, English might not be suitable – then I will consider using another language.” I interviewed Muling He, an undergraduate in Carnegie Mellon University who speaks Mandarin, English, Spanish, Japanese and Russian, as well as being able to read or communicate in other languages. The greatest advantage of multilingualism, as He claims, is the privilege to express one thought in the most efficient way. When comparing the languages he knows and explaining the major difference he felt after being able to speak multiple languages, He points out the different aspects in languages would help him to optimize his expression: Chinese is a beautiful language that creates elegant writing; Spanish is quite close to English but contains more cultural contents, while English, since it has been simplified a lot in history, functions perfectly as a global communication vehicle because of its simplicity and logic. On the other hand, Japanese might not be very persuasive when formulating logical arguments since its grammar is somehow long and unnecessary. As a multilingual, such understanding of unique structure of languages can easily be obtained and apply to the expression of ideas. 

                                    </br></br>  Nevertheless, the most “explicit” advantage of being a multilingual is that they can interact with more people. As a linguistic lover, He’s motivation for learning multiple languages is not because living under different language environments, but the will to gain a broader view of the world. According to him, his major motivations for learning multiple languages are to talk with different people and read books without translation.  For the example in the Multilingual Identity and Digital Translanguaging by Schreiber, the university student Aleksandar can post on his Facebook in both English and Serbian, and with the attitude of translangauging, he interacted with different audiences and built up his self-image in the global hip-hop community. “…the student integrates diverse linguistic and semiotic resources into a unified expression of identity, relying on the multimodal affordances of digital writing to accomplish his communicative goals.”(Schreiber, 2015) As the globalization going on, most of the people today relies on multiple languages to reach out for a broader audience, instead of only the local community. In this way, multiple languages definitely help people to present a better self, compared to using just one language. 

                                    

                                    </br></br>  But we still have a crucial problem: Will multiple languages separate the identity of a user? Given the idea of “learn a new language, gain a new soul”, as stated by Firmat in “no one true language”, it seems like multilinguals can have a hard time to find the “true” expression, like Firmat himself. Firmat links Spanish with his father’s curse and English with his family as the language of love, whereas it does seem impossible to unite them. Indeed, we can find no way to deny the difference in language, as proposed by He, “Comparing the languages, their major differences are indeed created by culture. The grammar structure of Japan is quite sophisticated such that it can hardly express the subtle inner thought of mind – but it’s more important that the culture of Japan doesn’t allow them to express such passionate emotions explicitly.” 

                                    </br></br>But there is no restrictions of “what language can do” and “and what language can’t do”. As McWhorter argues in Does language shapes what you think, language can hardly affect our logical thought and daily behavior, even the examples of male/female vocabulary or geographic coordinates always gives us a misunderstanding like that. We might wonder after He’s introduction of Japanese language, does it mean that a native Japanese speaker will never be good at expressing the nuanced thoughts because of the limitations of the language? That’s also not the case. He argues, “The Japanese use imagery. If you read the Japanese novels like those of Kawabata Yasunari, you will realize that they mostly entrust their feelings on the objects, sceneries, and secretly convey them to others without any explicit statements.” So it’s surprising that they found another style to express inner feelings; what He given us is the point that language will never restrict or shape our identity: if something exists in your mind, there is always a way to present it. That is why, given that the languages are fundamentally different in context of grammar, vocabulary, or structure, they will not conflict each other by their cultural mark – and thus, fortunately, the multilinguals will not have separated self-images. “Concepts always come first, and language comes the second to describe it. We can’t use language to ‘define’ a concept.” 

                                    </br></br>Back to Firmat’s case, he found it hard to integrate the two languages is mostly resulted from the unique language environment that plant within his experience. This change, or any degree of separation of language identity, is more related to the culture rather than the language itself. In a research conducted in 2008 that allows participants to recognize the emotional weight of “I love you” in their first language as well as foreign languages, it drew the conclusion that “the emotion script of love resembles the multicompetent users themselves, i.e. it is unique and everevolving.”(Dewaele, 2008) That implies the emotional effect on people depends on the idea itself but not the language. For He, a multilingual student who mostly interact with books, teachers, classmates, the perception of languages is less biased. Without interacting with different cultural environment, like Firmat’s father and wife, He barely felt the conflicts of languages that shape his character or behavior. Thus we can be sure that, the fact of being a multilingual itself will not interfere with the person’s presentation of self-image. 

                                    </br></br>Generalizing the points that presented in different articles, academic journals, as well as personal interviews, it’s not hard to see that multilingual has the ability to express themselves more comprehensively in several aspects: they can find a better expression with the understanding of different languages; they can easily communicate with more people, and their identity will not be utterly changed just because they use so many languages. In conclusion, the “language lens” is not as complex as it seems, and it will never be a burden to people.
